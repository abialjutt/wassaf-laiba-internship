It really depends on what kind of trip it is.
If it’s a trip involving outdoor adventures 
like camping, or visiting the beach or a pool on any given day,
then chances are the styling will be minimal — after shampooing and 
conditioning (I wash my hair every day),
I’ll work in some leave-in conditioner,
let it air dry and then do a ponytail,
bun or a french twist with a claw clip.
Maybe if I’m feeling ambitious
I’ll comb the cray-cray baby hairs down with some brow gel.
Funny thing is whenever we take these kind of outdoorsy trips, even though I know I’ll be doing the bare minimum with my hair, that doesn’t stop me from bringing a styling tool every single time. What can I say? There’s something about having the option to do my hair that’s kinda comforting to me!
